# Introduction
This repository contains the source code for a submitted article. It investigates the effect of 
equations of motion and optimal control problems formulations (explicit and implicit)
to solve trampoline Miller optimal control problems with direct multiple shooting.

The repository is made available as accompanying material of [this publication](tobepublished):
